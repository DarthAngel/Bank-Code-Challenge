# Bank-Code-Challenge

For this exercise we used SwiftUI + Combine Framework to provide reactive properties to the code.
For devices not supporting iOS 13, SwiftUI has to be replaced by UIKit.
No Cocoapods / Caarthage / Swift Package was needed for this exercise.
We used the MVVM pattern since it's the default pattern for SwiftUI. MVVM has a better decoupling for unit testing that MVC. A VIPER pattern is overkill for an app of this complexity.

TODO:

For persistance we could have used Core Data.
We could also have added unit tests for all the extension functions and webservice class.
